# 🌿 DanK Pay

**Solana-based QR Payment & Rewards Platform for Cannabis Retail**

DanK Pay enables dispensaries to accept fast, secure, and low-cost crypto payments using the utility token **DanKBud** (`$DKBUD`). Built on Solana, it replaces cash with a fully digital payment flow, integrated with wallet apps and fiat conversion.

> 💡 “Scan. Pay. Swap your $DKBUDs for buds.”

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Customer scans a QR code at checkout (generated by merchant)
2. The DanKPay mobile app converts fiat to `$DKBUD` using a connected wallet (e.g., Phantom)
3. The dispensary receives `$DKBUD`, auto-converted to fiat (USDC) for bank deposit
4. Loyalty rewards and cashback features are built-in
