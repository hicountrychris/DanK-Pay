## 🌍 Why DanK Pay?

Cannabis retailers in the U.S. often operate **cash-only** due to federal banking restrictions. This leads to:

- ⛔ High ATM fees
- 💵 Security risks with physical cash
- 🧾 Accounting complications

**DanK Pay** solves this with a Solana-based utility token that powers a QR payment app, allowing users to pay digitally and dispensaries to receive funds instantly — even auto-converted to fiat if desired.
