# DanK-Pay
Solana-based QR payment &amp; rewards platform for cannabis retail
# DanK Pay 💵🌿

**DanK Pay** is a Solana-based QR payment system and rewards platform built for legal cannabis dispensaries. Customers pay using `$DANK`, a utility token designed for fast, low-fee purchases — and dispensaries receive USD directly in their bank accounts without touching crypto.

## 🚀 What It Solves

- Cannabis businesses can’t access traditional banking and card processors
- Customers deal with ATM fees and cash-only transactions
- No loyalty, rewards, or fast checkout system exists for dispensaries

## 💡 How DanK Pay Works

1. Customer scans a QR code with their DanK Pay mobile wallet  
2. Pays instantly in `$DANK` (an SPL token on Solana)  
3. DanK Pay auto-swaps to USDC and deposits **USD into the dispensary’s bank account**  
4. Customer earns $DANK back as rewards  

> No crypto confusion. No cash handling. Just smooth payments.
